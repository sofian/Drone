 As of JDK1.3, the Java HTML facility is insufficient for use

<p>Welcome to Drone, an intuitive, component-oriented, multi-paradigm environment for the design of real-time 
media projects. It allows you to combine different visual programming paradigms in the same project, overcoming the 
limitations inherent to a single strategy.</p>

<p>Examples of target applications are: immersive installations, live audio-video performances and interactive web 
works. Drone is specially well-suited for rapid integration of existing software components, concurrent system design 
and interdisciplinary works.</p>
