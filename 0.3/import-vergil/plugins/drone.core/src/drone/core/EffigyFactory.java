/**
 A configuration contains an instance of this class, and uses it to create
 effigies from a URL, or to create blank effigies of a particular kind.
 This base class assumes that it contains other effigy factories.
 Its createEffigy() methods defer to each contained factory in order
 until one is capable of creating an effigy. Subclasses of this class
 will usually be inner classes of an Effigy and will create the Effigy,
 or they might themselves be aggregates of instances of EffigyFactory.
