Description: state-of-the art interactive VJ-ing software.
 Drone is an open source software for digital and interactive arts. It
 allows the design of realtime signal processing machines for video and
 audio through a generic data flow interface.
 .
 Drone follows a fourfold developement philosophy:
 .
 * Open source : Drone is distributed under the GPL license and
   builds upon several open source softwares.
 * State-of-the art : Drone will implement the most up-to-date
   algorithms for signal processing, including feature extraction and
   automated generation.
 * Grandmotherproof : Drone provides a very intuitive
   interface, allowing the user to quickly learn how to use the software
   without even having to read any documentation. We want your
   grand-mother to start VJ-ing with a few clicks.
 * Extensible : Drone's data flow structure defines a
   meta-language for any kind of data processing, providing a strong
   basis upon which to build software.
